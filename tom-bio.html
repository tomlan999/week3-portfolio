      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      
      <p>I grew up in Tacoma, Washington, graduating from <a href="http://www.bellarmineprep.org/">Bellarmine Prep</a> in 1980.  Tacoma in the 1960s and 1970s was known for smelters and pulp mills and a decaying downtown core.  However, my world in Tacoma's North End was good.</p>

      <h2>The 1980s</h2>
      
      <p>Upon graduating highschool, I had three primary goals in life:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Party</li>
        <li>Party</li>
        <li>Party</li>
      </ol>

      <p>While these goals were rather easily achieved, they were not particularly conducive to career advancement.  I eventually enrolled at now-defunct Knapp Business College, earned a certificate in computer programming, and in March of 1986, started work at Safeco Insurance as a DP Courier.</p>
      
      <p>It was during this same time that I met and married my lovely wife, and moved to Renton, Washington to be closer to my work.</p>

      <h2>The 1990s</h2>
      
      <p>I moved around Safeco's Data Processing and General Operations departments for a few years, eventually landing in the Network Control Center, mostly by virtue of "knowing a guy," as I knew next to nothing about networking.  I graduated from the Helpdesk, to Network Analyst and Network Engineer.  I worked through networking's evolution from SNA networking to Novelle Netware LANs to IP networks, and from shared-media token ring, to ATM LAN Emulation, to switched Ethernet.</p>

      <p>During these years I also did the things many people do in their thirties.  My wife and I started a family, producing two beautiful daughters.  We bought our first house, in Renton, and when we outgrew that house, bought our second house in Kent, Washington.</p>

      <h2>The 2000s</h2>
      
      <p>In the 2000s, I started to move away from a "hands on keyboard" role, and into a planning and strategy role.  When Safeco formed an Enterprise Architecture practice in 2006, I became a Network Architect and then a Senior Network Architect.  The tools in my toolbox changed from Command Line Interface and O'Reilly guides, to Microsoft Powerpoint and architectural frameworks.</p>

        <figcaption>Being an IT Architect is more than just talking about the work that other people do...</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>In 2008, Safeco was acquired by Liberty Mutual Insurance.  Liberty Mutual is based on Boston, with IT Infrastructure based primarily in the Seacoast area of New Hampshire.  Prospects for continued employment looked bleak initially, but in reality, things have worked out well.</p>
      
      <p>In my non-work world, we moved again, from Kent to Maple Valley, Washington, my daughters worked their way through middle and high school, learned to drive and learned what an auto-body shop is, and we built a significant portion of our lives around club soccer and other sports activities.</p>

      <h2>The 2010s</h2>
      
      <p>The last few years of my work life have been increasingly about "The Cloud."  IT infrastructure is increasingly virtualized, and offered "as a service."  DevOps is merging application development with infrastructure operations, and furthering the idea of managing infrastructure as code.</p>

      <p>As my daughters graduate college and move on to grad school, and my wife and I consider our next move as empty nesters, it's clear that a broader technical skillset is required to remain relevant in the field of IT Infrastructure Architecture.  My goal is to use this class to start to broaden my technical skill set and continue on my career path.</p>
